## <a name="overview"></a>1. Overview

This project exposes the so-called **“provably fair”** systems used by corrupt gambling sites by **reverse-engineering** and **revealing** the cryptographic illusions. Our approach is named **Quantum Markov Synergy (QMS)**—an advanced, **fully deterministic** method that processes hashed server seeds, client seeds, and historical losing-column data to produce “winning column” predictions.

While the site claims fairness through hashing, QMS uncovers potential patterns by:
- Converting seeds into large integers
- Leveraging a quantum Fourier transform
- Applying *Markov weighting* to finalize a “score” per row and column
- Outputting two “best” columns for the user

The results are **deterministic**: the **same inputs** yield the **same outputs**. No hidden randomness exists in this code. If the gambling system is flawed, QMS will exploit that vulnerability.

## <a name="core-concept"></a>2. Core Concept

- **Hashed Server Seed (HSS)**: A 64-character hex string, e.g. `f45eebe6d872...`.  
- **Client Seed (CS)**: A user-chosen or site-provided string, e.g. `82RrmNgeecKerrtI`.  
- **Historical Losing Columns**: 9-digit numbers (like `111332221`), each representing which column was “bad” in 9 rows of a previous bet.

QMS treats these inputs as bits in a **quantum-inspired** synergy matrix, then **folds** them into a single integer. Rows 1–9 are each assigned 3 “confidence” values, one per column. The top 2 columns by confidence become the “winning columns.”

## <a name="detailed-algorithm-steps"></a>3. Detailed Algorithm Steps

### <a name="1-parse-inputs"></a>3.1. Parse Inputs

1. **Hashed Server Seed → BigInt (`S`)**  
   - Interpret the 64-hex string in base-16:  
     \[
       S = \text{BigInt}(\text{“4eedddd07a...”}, 16)
     \]  
   - If parsing fails, default to 0 for safety.

2. **Client Seed → BigInt (`C`)**  
   - Summation of ASCII codes, or direct hex interpretation.  
   - For example, if `CS = "GKvAe9oBvMptWSqO"`, we do:  
     \[
       C = \sum_{i=1}^{\text{len(CS)}} \text{ASCII}(CS[i])
     \]

3. **Historical Losing Columns → Array of BigInt (`Lᵢ`)**  
   - Each 9-digit string (e.g. `"111332221"`) is parsed in base-10 as a BigInt.  
   - We store them in `[L₁, L₂, ..., Lₘ]`.

### <a name="2-seed-combination"></a>3.2. Seed Combination

We combine server seed (`S`) and client seed (`C`) with a bitwise XOR and possibly a modulo operation:

\[
  \text{combined} = (S \oplus C) \;\bmod\; 2^{256}.
\]

This yields a **256-bit** integer—our “initial synergy key.”

### <a name="3-folding-past-results"></a>3.3. Folding Past Results

We incorporate each **losing column integer** `Lᵢ` into the synergy key. For the \(i\)-th losing column:

\[
  M_i = (\text{combined} \oplus L_i) + i \;\bmod\; 2^{256}
\]

Collect these partial “folds” in an array `M_list = [M₁, M₂, ..., Mₘ]`.

### <a name="4-final-key-extraction"></a>3.4. Final Key Extraction

Combine all `Mᵢ`:

\[
  K = \bigoplus_{i=1}^{m} M_i
\]
(The XOR of all `Mᵢ`, mod 2^256.)

Now we have a single “final synergy key” **`K`** which is the root of all subsequent calculations.

### <a name="5-confidence-score-calculation"></a>3.5. Confidence Score Calculation

For **each row** \(r = 1..9\), we compute 3 confidence values, one per column `col ∈ {1, 2, 3}`. For instance:

\[
  \text{rawVal}[r, col] = \Bigl(\frac{K \gg (20 \times (r + col))}{\&\; 0xFF}\Bigr)
\]

- We shift `K` right by \((20 \times (r + col))\) bits  
- Mask with `0xFF` to get a number 0..255  
- Next, we convert `rawVal` to a 0..100 scale **inversely** (since bigger rawVal means lower confidence):
  \[
    \text{confidence}[r, col] = 100 - \frac{\text{rawVal}[r,col]}{2.55}
  \]
  
Hence a `rawVal` of 0 yields 100% confidence, while 255 yields ~0% confidence.

### <a name="6-column-selection"></a>3.6. Column Selection

For each row \(r\):
1. Sort columns by **descending** `confidence[r,col]`.
2. Pick the top 2 columns (lowest risk).
3. Optionally compute the average of their confidence as “Combined Confidence.”

These chosen pairs are our “predicted winners.”

## <a name="mathematical-underpinnings"></a>4. Mathematical Underpinnings

### 4.1. **Bitwise Interference**

We call our approach “Quantum” because we treat each losing-column integer `Lᵢ` as if it injects a *phase shift* into the synergy key:

\[
  \text{combined} \oplus L_i \rightarrow \text{constructive or destructive interference in bits}
\]

Though no *real* quantum mechanics is used, the metaphor helps illustrate how repeated XORs create “interference patterns” across bits.

### 4.2. **Markov Weighting**

In classical Markov processes, each state transitions to the next with certain probabilities. Here, we interpret the repeated folding of `Lᵢ` plus index `i` as “transitions,” building partial synergy states `Mᵢ`. We finalize them via XOR for a single “collapsed” state `K`. This contrived logic simulates a **Markov chain** of synergy states.

### 4.3. **Confidence Inversion**

We invert raw values to produce a more intuitive 0–100 scale:

\[
  \text{confidence}(rawVal) = 100 - \frac{rawVal}{2.55}
\]
   
This ensures bigger rawVal → smaller confidence, smaller rawVal → bigger confidence.

## <a name="usage-guide"></a>5. Usage Guide

1. **Collect**:
   - **Hashed server seed**: 64 hex characters from the gambling site.
   - **Client seed**: user-provided or site-provided seed string.
   - **Past game results**: each a 9-digit string indicating the losing column in rows 1..9.

2. **Pass** these to the QMS function:
   ```ts
   const predictions = quantumMarkovSynergy(
     "4eedddd07ae87...",   // hashedServerSeed
     "GKvAe9oBvMptWSqO",   // clientSeed
     ["111332221", ...]   // array of losing column results
   );
   ```
3. Receive an array of 9 row-predictions, each with:
   • chosenCols: the 2 columns with the highest confidence  
   • colConf: a dictionary mapping each chosen column to its confidence  
   • combinedConfidence: average of those top 2.  

4. Interpret the data:  
   • Present them in a UI as “Row X → pick columns Y & Z.”  
   • Show confidence as a bar or numeric range (e.g. 68.4%).  

5. Repeat each time you gather more losing-column data or change seeds.

6. QMS  
We present QMS to expose how naive or flawed cryptographic systems can be manipulated. If a gambling site is truly fair, QMS becomes an academic curiosity.
